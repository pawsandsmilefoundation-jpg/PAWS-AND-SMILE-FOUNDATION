Paws and Smile Foundation is a unique non-profit organization dedicated to creating a more compassionate world by addressing the powerful, interconnected well-being of both animals and people. We believe that animal welfare and human community development are not separate causes, but are intrinsically linked, each capable of enriching the other.
